# 🌌 Chengxu (Leo) Liu
**Theoretical Physics | Computational Modeling | Machine Learning**

Currently a first-year MSci Physics student at **University College London (UCL)**. I bridge rigorous theoretical physics with advanced computational techniques. Rather than conforming to standard undergraduate pacing, I independently master graduate-level physics texts and architect machine learning models to tackle complex systems. 

**🎯 Actively seeking Summer Research Internships and Transfer Opportunities to top-tier physics programs.**
